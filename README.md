# Home-Value-Estimation


This project is a regression analysis for Home Values based on a few variables such as square feet of the home, number of bedrooms, if there is a garage, etc.
It also gives users the option to input their own values and the model will spit out an estimation. 


# Please Note!

The home value training data is synthetic. In the future, I might come back and make the training data real, as well as include stuff like zip code as a variable for the model. But for now, I have left the script used to generate the training data as well as a csv that contains that training data. 

Overall, this project has helped me to get some experience building a linear regression model in Python, and build something that somebody else could use, even if the functionality is limited, being as there is not a GUI and the training data is synthetic.
